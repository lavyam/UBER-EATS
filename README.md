# UBER-EATS
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/uber-eats-usa-restaurants-menus?resource=download
In my project I would want to focus on regression. Using this I would want to find the least squares line and see how well it performs in predicting data. My target variable would be the price range of the restaurant and my features would be the restaurant score, rating, zipcode, latitude, longitude, etc. I would want to start my project by first validating and clean the data set, later I would want to formulate the matrix for regression. Next, I would want to fit the least squares line and finally I would want to plot all the points as a scatterplot. 
My resources would include numpy, matplotlib, lambda functions, Kaggle and a few more if needed.
